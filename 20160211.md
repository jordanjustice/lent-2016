This year, more so than any other year that I've celebrated lent, I've had a really hard time deciding what to give up or "fast" from. All the obvious things–social media, alcohol, television, coffee–I did previously and it was okay. Socially, alcohol was the most difficult. Several parties, concerts with dinners at breweries before, all showed me how intertwined my, or our, lifestyles are with booze. And I don't have problems with that.

So what am I fasting from this year? Nothing. Or at least I don't know yet. One thing I do know for sure is that I'm committed to writing everyday. No specific amount, but I have some targets in my head. Why writing? Well I'm not entirely sure about that either. Occasionally when I'm talking to a friend, they might say, "Man, you should really write about that and share." Now perhaps they're just being nice. Regardless, most of the time the "write about that" part seems tempting. Maybe if I wrote it down, it'd help clear my head, and polish the thought a bit more. That could help me articulate it more clearly next time I talk about it as well. As far as sharing goes, I may share some writings during this time, and I may not. We'll see.

What am I writing about? Again, I don't know yet. Previously, my only real writing time has been directed towards writing things about the faith. Which is good and I enjoy. But I'm also now more open to write about other areas that I have a lot thoughts on, like web design/development. For the past five-ish years, I've spent eight hours a day making stuff for the web. I've read a lot by other people making stuff, or at least pretending they do, and I think I could join in the stream of thought. Another area that I may put sometime into writing is our local biking scene. Perhaps a "State of the Bike in Toledo" would help connect some of the dots for people. How has our government helped or not? Who are the people doing great things? Who are the people standing in the way? How can YOU get involved?

One hope I have from this too, is to become a little bit better of a writer. To more intuitively craft a well stated argument and back it up. All that stuff you should be rememebering for you comp course. Right?

Well, that's my intro. I'm done for today.
